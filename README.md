# 🕒 Work Faster – A Cute Pomodoro Timer App with React + Electron

 **cute and simple Pomodoro-style timer app** using **React**.

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download)  
  (It comes with `npx`, which we’ll use to create the project)

---


## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Create Your React App

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx create-react-app work-faster --template typescript
```

This creates a new folder called work-faster with a pre-configured React + TypeScript setup.
Then move into your new project folder:

```bash
cd work-faster
```

### 2. Install Electron
Still inside the project folder, run:

```bash
npm install --save-dev electron
```

### 3. Test the React App
Before we wire up Electron, make sure React works:

```bash
npm run start
```

This should open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000

🎉 If you see the React welcome screen, you're all set!
